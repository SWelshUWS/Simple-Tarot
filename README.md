# Simple-Tarot
A simple text based Tarot application

Readings include:
  * single card
  * triple card
  * celtic cross 

To compile: 
  * $git clone https://github.com/SWelshUWS/Simple-Tarot
  * $gcc -o tarot tarot.c
  * then run with $./tarot

This will eventually be expanded to include reversed cards and hopefully some cool graphics (ha). Would also be good to provide card meanings from the web at some point.
